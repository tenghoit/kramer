Here are the student-style notes in the same format as before (bullet-based, readable, slightly informal, one intentionally missing topic).
Below the notes, I list which topic(s) I intentionally left out.

Slides What is an Agent

⭐ Why This Topic Matters

“Agents” have been a core AI idea for decades.

LLM-based systems are basically reviving the classical agent idea but with new capabilities.

Before building one, we need shared terminology for how agents perceive, decide, and act.

⭐ Roadmap for Today

Classical view: agents, environments, rational action.

How these concepts map to LLM-powered systems.

Look ahead to adding an agentic loop to the Lab 6 pipeline.

Key reminder: almost everything we build is some variation of:
perceive → decide → act.

⭐ Agents (Classical View)
What an Agent Is

A system that perceives its environment through inputs
→ each input = a percept
→ all past percepts = percept sequence

Acts on the environment through outputs (e.g., SQL calls, messages, API requests).

Sometimes the correct action is no action (safe refusal).

Updated for our course

Input could be: user natural-language request.

Output could be: a SQL query, a chatbot reply, or “insufficient context.”

Think of everything in terms of the observe → decide → act loop.

⭐ Rationality (Classical Definition)
Rational Agent

A rational agent picks the action that maximizes expected value of its performance measure.

It does this based on:

what it has observed (percept sequence),

what built-in knowledge it has,

and the constraints of real-time compute + exploration.

Rational ≠ Perfect

Rational agents operate with incomplete info + limited compute.

They learn to improve future actions.

True autonomy = filling in gaps of prior knowledge.

Example: a dung beetle follows rules but doesn’t adapt → not considered rational.

⭐ Environments
Task Environments

The “problem setup” that agents act within.

Classical AI uses PEAS to define the task environment.

PEAS

P — Performance measure

E — Environment

A — Actuators

S — Sensors

Framework for specifying what the agent is solving and how.

⭐ From Classical Agents → LLM Agents

The same theory still works — our environment is digital rather than physical.

Everything we’ve built so far (chatbots, classifiers, NL→SQL pipelines) functions like a tiny agent:

perceives the input text,

decides what to do,

acts via output or SQL.

Adding feedback loops, memory, iterative planning starts turning these tools into agentic systems.

⭐ Looking Ahead

Lab 6 → Safe NL→SQL pipeline (non-agentic).

Lab 7 → Add an agentic loop that reasons, tests, and improves.

We should keep asking: What counts as a rational action for our app?

Classical AI gives the foundation; modern agentic systems extend it.
